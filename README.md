# Calory_Calculator

The aim of this app is to check in the evening: 
- whether and which dishes could still be consumed so that the calorie limit is not exceeded 
- whether the protein intake is sufficient.

The menu is entered into Google Tabs, which also contains a nutritional table of meals. The Python script is then used to calculate a nutritional table of the food consumed (Calories, Fats, Carbohydrates and Proteins). This data from the current day is the used in the application.
